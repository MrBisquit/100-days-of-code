<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: 9th September 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- Added a search to BSS-TrafficControl.
- Updated .gitignore to ignore generated files on BSS-TrafficControl.
- Added actual logs so basic logging of traffic works on BSS-TrafficControl.
- Added the actual code for getting the logs from the server and refreshing the table on BSS-TrafficControl.
- Modified Refresh Button on the Admin Panel of BSS-TrafficControl.
- Stopped overlapping in table on the Admin Panel of BSS-TrafficControl.
- Made the table better with new columns on BSS-TrafficControl.
- Added a popup to show more information about the log (Not fully working yet) on BSS-TrafficControl.

**Thoughts**: Got quite a bit done today, hoping to get equally as much done as today tommorow. I'm using "BSS-TrafficControl) in these points quite a lot, I'll try not to do that tommorow.

### Day 3: 10th September 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- Fixed some bugs on BSS-TrafficControl causing the Admin page to not load correctly/not load at all half of the time.
- Added second popup that comes from the first one that shows them more information about the user, neither of these work fully yet.
- Added a loading page, it's pointless but it still looks nice.
- Data should load instantly on the "Monitor & Manage Traffic" tab on the Admin Panel.
- Modified the Refresh Button again so that it actually loads data.
- Added an offline popup that stops all requests and tells the user that they are offline since it requires and internet connection for things to work and it'll just throw errors and break stuff if it isn't stopped.

**Thoughts**: Also made quite a bit of progress today, aiming to get a heartbeat done at some point so I can make some cool statistics page that tells the admin the amount of active users and other statistics like that.
